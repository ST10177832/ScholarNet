# ScholarNet
ScholarNet is an app built for students to make learning easier and more organized. With quick access to notes, study guides, and other resources sorted by grade and subject, we don’t have to search everywhere for what we need—it’s all right here! From a simple login, we can download PDFs, check grades, and keep track of our progress.
